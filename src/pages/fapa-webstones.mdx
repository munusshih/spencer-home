# [Touching Computers Workshop](/creation/touching-computers-creating-data-talismans)

You can always refer back to this website! https://spencer.place/webstones

## hi i'm spencer

i'm an indie engineer & internet artist. I make various experiments with computers that broadly focus on communal computing, or how computers can bring people together and empower us to shape technology towards what we care about.

Whether a seasonal website, an open-source library for making tiny social networks, or webstones, these works all explore a new relationship to technology and to each other through technology.

## what is a webstone?

## How does it work?

NFC chips are the same technology you use for Apple Pay, transit cards, etc. People also use them as business cards, but we're gonna make something that fits the function.

</div>

At this point, most phones work, but it's been a slow adoption process since the technology was first introduced.

## Working with Clay

As we pass out the materials, please introduce yourselves to the person next to you! You'll be helping each other work with clay and programming your computers.

- **SKETCH FIRST**: clay gets "worked" fast. try to get to a general shape of what you want to make first and then smooth out cracks with water and create details with more bits of clay
- **NFC TAG**: you want to make your full shape and then put the nfc in a place where you cover it with another layer of clay
  - think about where you want the phone to tap for your design
  - you can always rewrite / reprogram the nfc chip
- **THICKER TO BE SAFE**: thinner pieces are more delicate and may crack as they dry, so try to give everything a pretty good thickness (recommended at least a quarter-half inch.

## Programming the Computing Function

Downlood NFC TOOLS on iOS or Android to program.

## Gifting Exercise

Let's make something to gift to someone here! We'll make a vessel to hold a note for someone else in the room. Write a wish or reminder for them.

## Finishing the Webstone at home

- let it dry overnight for at least a couple days. preferably near a window with indirect light (direct light may dry it too quickly and cause more cracks)
- painting it: any kind of acrylic paint (available at your local arts store or amazon)
- finishing it: mod podge, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Liquitex-5004-Professional-Medium-Firnis/dp/B000KNNJW8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&psc=1&smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&language=de_DE">acrylic varnish</a>, lacquer varnish (all available at your local arts store or amazon)
