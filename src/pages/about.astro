      <p>Growing up, I never felt like I fit in at school or local communities. Instead, I grew up on the internet. The internet was where I found my community, learned what it meant to have a passion, and discovered the range of humanityâ€”how tender and how heartless people could be. I fell into making technology because it felt like a way to carry on the kindnesses that I was shown. I want to make the internet a place that can facilitate the intimacy, creation, and solidarity I found.</p>

  <p>I'm an engineer, artist, and researcher. My practice focuses on stewarding the internet towards a space that empowers us to love each other and create together. To do this, I provide alternatives and provide tools for making those alternatives through making:</p>

  <p>that highlight the humanity inherent to all technology and empower us to actively shape computing. I want to create space for human-computer dialogue, so that computing becomes a material for people to express themselves, cherish others, and create the possibility for imaginative change.</p>
