        <p>Spencer Chang is an engineer, artist, and designer stewarding the internet towards a medium for intimacy, creation, and solidarity. Spanning open-source infrastructure, participatory environments, creative tools, and multimedia installations, their interdisciplinary and interdependent practice empower (and rely upon) visitors to make their own technological narratives and discover the poetics and solidarity latent in our everyday actions and encounters. In their focus on infrastructural work, Spencer continues the path laid by “maintenance art,” where “the working is the art,” to imagine, realize, and maintain an approach to technology as a conduit for communal humanity. Their work has been featured and supported by the de Young Museum, CultureHub, MIT Technology Review, Frieze, and Gray Area.</p>

        <h3 >1. invite me to speak / teach / install</h3>
        <p>I've spoken across a range of institutions, including U. Penn., Gray Area, and for W3C community group meetings. I've led workshops at Stanford University and Gray Area.</p>
        <p>I've exhibited multimedia installations and internet art at Gray Area, the de Young Museum, and CultureHub. I'd love to create more installations, both ones that build upon existing net art and infrastructural work and new creations.</p>

        <h3>2. commission me</h3>

I'm available for custom commisssions of integrated digital-physical experiences that can be customized to receipients.</p>
