        <p>This project started with finding a way to document my intention to try new outfits every day. I ended up kicking off a <a href="https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1421244720638873603?s=21">twitter thread</a> but soon found it difficult to keep it updated. I wanted somewhere permanent to reference my growing collection and have a lightweight action to document it to avoid making dressing up feel like a chore.</p>
        <p>So, I created an automated process for taking my fit of the day, uploading it to cloud storage, and serving the photos from my website. Now I can just tell anyone to go to the fits tab on my website, and the best part is that it&#39;ll stay updated live with minimal effort.</p>
        <p>I&#39;ve written about why I&#39;m going to all this effort and why I care about fashion in <a href="/posts/denim-personality">denim personality</a> and <a href="https://reallifemag.com/worn-out/">this piece</a> in Real Life Mag gets at why it&#39;s important.</p>
