# Webstones Workshop

tips

- try to get to a general shape of what you want to make first and then smooth out cracks with water and create details with more bits of clay
- you want to make your full shape and then put the nfc in a place where you cover it with another layer of clay
  - think about where you want the phone to tap for your design
  - you can always rewrite / reprogram the nfc chip
- dont make the clay too thin some cracks may appear as it dries

## Finishing the Webstone at home

- let it dry overnight for at least a couple days. preferably near a window with indirect light (direct light may dry it too quickly and cause more cracks)
- painting it: any kind of acrylic paint (available at your local arts store or amazon)
- finishing it: mod podge, acrylic varnish, lacquer varnish (available at your local arts store or amazon)
