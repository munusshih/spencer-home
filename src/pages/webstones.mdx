# [Touching Computers Workshop](/creation/touching-computers-creating-data-talismans) Instructions

Thanks for joining for the workshop!

### Tips while working

- try to get to a general shape of what you want to make first and then smooth out cracks with water and create details with more bits of clay
- you want to make your full shape and then put the nfc in a place where you cover it with another layer of clay
  - think about where you want the phone to tap for your design
  - you can always rewrite / reprogram the nfc chip
- dont make the clay too thin some cracks may appear as it dries

### Finishing the Webstone at home

- let it dry overnight for at least a couple days. preferably near a window with indirect light (direct light may dry it too quickly and cause more cracks)
- painting it: any kind of acrylic paint (available at your local arts store or amazon)
- finishing it: mod podge, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Liquitex-5004-Professional-Medium-Firnis/dp/B000KNNJW8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&psc=1&smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&language=de_DE">acrylic varnish</a>, lacquer varnish (all available at your local arts store or amazon)
