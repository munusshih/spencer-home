_Four days ago I watched the day turn dark as the moon passed over the sun. Three days ago I turned 27. Two months and one year ago, I announced my new chapter as an "independent researcher," which I described as moving [towards flight](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/towards-flight). Today I check in with myself on how this new life has been like._

### **what's happened since last year**

It doesn't feel real that it's already been more than a year. I feel simultaneously like I've lived a lifetime and like every month flashes by in a blur. In this period, I've had the best and the most miserable days of my life, sometimes following one another. Some spans felt blissfully full and others felt like a slow strangle. Still, I am constantly struck with gratitude for my privilege to indulge in my diversity of explorations and all the people I've been able to collaborate with.

Since last February, I started my [public research log](https://spencerchang.substack.com/s/tiny-internets), created my most [ambitious poetic website](https://htmls.garden/) to date for [the HTML Review](https://thehtml.review/02) (thank you Shelby and Max!), released an [open-source library](https://github.com/spencerc99/playhtml) for [making the web more alive](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-08-aliving-the-web) (thank you Jacky and Sunil), created my [first mobile app](https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1749590601790861480) (that I now use almost daily!), learned about [solidarity infrastructures](https://sfpc.study/sessions/spring-23/solidarity-infra) from my lovely teachers at [SFPC](https://sfpc.study/) (thank you Alice, Max, and Mark!), [exhibited my work in a museum](https://deyoungopen2023.artcall.org/submissions/qr-view/424024), found it featured in some wonderful publications both [digital](https://www.frieze.com/article/online-publications-bridging-poetry-and-code) (Thank you Meg!) and [print](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/21/1084525/internet-whimsy-html-energy/) (thank you Tiff), gave a poetry reading for Kernel's 3rd Issue launch (thank you Jess and Jess), and created a [website you can touch](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/touching-computers).

I put out a bat call for collaborators and got to talk and exchange ideas with so many people that I admire. I crafted a [home for internet dreams](https://we-b.site/) (we would love to host yours too!) and conducted a conversation over a digital campfire on Discord on [making welcoming digital spaces](https://campfire.we-b.site/) with [Jacky](https://jzhao.xyz/). I jammed on protocols with the [Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/) squad, hosted a [HTML Energy](https://html.energy/) meetup to make websites in the park, ran communal computing workshops at [DWeb Camp](https://dwebcamp.org/), collected a [syllabus for taking an internet walk](https://syllabusproject.org/syllabus-for-taking-an-internet-walk/) with [Kristoffer](https://kristoffer.substack.com/), enjoyed the pleasure of looking through 200+ poetic websites as part of [Tiny Awards](https://tinyawards.net/) (thank you Kristoffer!), worked on local-first clients with [Canvas'](https://canvas.xyz/) support, and gave a guest lecture about reclaiming the internet at U. Penn (thank you [Elan](https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/) and your students for welcoming me!)[^1].

Outside of these "professional" endeavors, I also completed several "side quests" that I've always dreamed of. I learned how to [barista professionally](https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1629293479825375233), experimented with [ceramics](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1yQ2WAODJu/?img_index=1), [toured the SF dump](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/two-questions), took a sculpture class, went to the Vintage Computer Festival with O, and scootered down the side of Taiwan with R.

I'm scheming grants for working on the next big chapter of [playhtml](https://playhtml.fun/), creating the infrastructure for a social fabric that overlays our existing internet. I'm so close to releasing Gather in a public form, forming a foundation for community-created interfaces for data archival and curation. After releasing [SIGIL I](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/touching-computers), I'm planning my first set of workshops around creating data talismans, planting the seeds for custom commissions, and designing a set of public physical installations (and received a mention from Robin Sloan's esteemed [Trespassers newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/is-it-drugs/)). Next Wednesday, I'm giving a comprehensive talk about my practice for the first time at [Gray Area](https://grayarea.org/event/gray-area-incubator-salon-2024-1/).

I'm distilling my philosophy into a comprehensive statement, creating a multimedia installation and my most ambitious internet art concept to date. I'm in the earliest stages of co-designing a syllabus, working to form the partnerships I've dreamed of, and establishing a consistent and authentic way to describe my wide-ranging work and identity, without needing to caveat.

---

At the same time, I got rejected from countless grant and residency applications, experienced the pain of a major publication's column dissolving suddenly before the piece I wrote for them released, and beat myself up for not working fast and hard enough. I hurt people I love balancing too many projects and stumbling my way through how to work and talk about myself in the world of art and independent work. I've driven myself into the ground, constantly pushing myself to go faster, broken down on sidewalks, roofs, and park benches from all the pressure, doubted whether anything I make has meaning, and questioned whether I deserve the privilege to bet so much on myself. I wasn't (and still aren't) sure whether I can sustain myself independently moving forward, especially for a lifetime.

One night at 3am, I experienced a moment that almost shattered me. I was forced to reconcile my beliefs of the internet with the very real horrors of it when I discovered [(we)b.site](https://we-b.site/)'s database had been hacked and replaced entirely with a very hateful comment. I proceeded to patch the security hole and painstakingly restore letters from an earlier [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) snapshot manually[^2].

I couldn't believe something so innocuous could trigger someone to go through so much effort to ruin it. L told me that perhaps, its hopeful and tender nature was what made it so provocative, especially in a world where technology is decidedly not so. What once haunted me as a traumatic night has since become a cherished reminder of the importance (radicality, even?) of my work.

To reach an internet that cultivates mutual love, we have to move through the hate, pain, and existing preconceptions of what it is _for_ and can be. We have to be able to first imagine, and then, create different possibilities for how technology can bring people together and help us create a better world.

### **what I do & care about**

This year, I spent a lot of time figuring out how to succinctly and precisely describe what I do and care about. Every time someone I met asked me what I do, I would scramble between a dozen variations, catering what I included to the scene I was in. I've been slowly moving towards being able to talk about myself in one consistent way across all the contexts I found myself in.

For a while, I tried on a bunch of unique and completely made-up "professions" to describe my craft. From "internet architect" and "internet ecologist"[^3] to "internet groundskeeper" and "internet plumber."

In the end, I settled on something simpler. I returned to a term that originates from Kristoffer's kind, kind [description of my work](https://www.naiveweekly.com/p/url-poetry-club?publication_id=3348&post_id=136896792&isFreemail=true&r=2037y) as an "internet caretaker."

We live in an age of "personal computing." Even as our devices bring us into vast "social media" spaces where we _can_ connect to billions of other people, it doesn't feel like we're surrounded by people. We're often staring at our screens alone; we have personalized experiences on _our_ unique feed.

Our encounters with other people are merely coincidental. We are not meant to connect, only to consume.

Beyond our siloed digital experiences, our imaginations for the use of technology are haunted by extractive platforms, surveillance technology, conducting [murder](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/), increasingly [closed platforms](https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/6/14/23760738/reddit-blackout-explained-subreddit-apollo-third-party-apps), and software that [simply doesn't work](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/25/is-software-getting-worse/").

And yet, people still carve out community in the most hostile of places and subvert platforms to create space for human-first desires. We create [solidarity infrastructure](https://sfpc.study/sessions/spring-23/solidarity-infra) out of text chains, subvert government control through [form submissions](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277423/k-pop-dallas-pd-iwatch-app-flood-review-bomb-surveillance-protests-george-floyd), and carve intimate sanctuaries in the comment sections and profiles of algorithmically controlled wastelands. We make magic out of our internet spaces in the same ways we do in the physical world: when we smile at a stranger on the street or reply with our story in a wayward forum, when we make food for our loved ones or when we [make a website for those we love](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-11-dedications-gifts-odes), when we offer our space and labor to our community or when we make a [small tool for them](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-10-make-small-web-tools).

Despite all the terrible things that some use the internet to do, all the hate that is spread, I can't help but see all the reasons that humans should exist when I look at the internet, in all the gestures of love, tenderness, imagination, and whimsy. In every corner—from facebook groups in which [everyone pretends to be an ant](https://www.are.na/block/27154504) & [youtube comments of forlorn love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4lwuNWBOA4) to [yahoo answers](https://www.theverge.com/22368753/yahoo-answers-best-funny-shut-down) & [tiktoks about the people on google maps](https://www.are.na/block/25921906) to [handmade homes](https://www.are.na/spencer-chang/textured-websites) & [business websites with personality](https://www.are.na/spencer-chang/fun-business-websites), these [tiny internets](https://tiny-inter.net/) sprout and bloom. Like digital moss, they spring up everywhere even when you try to stamp them out.

I dream of an age of [communal computing](https://www.are.na/spencer-chang/communal-computing-infrastructure), where they—computers, the internet, our network of online devices—feel like ubiquitous reminders of our capacity for creativity, intimacy, and solidarity. An age where technology became a vehicle of liberation for our dreams of not only existing in a harder world, but also flourishing, together.

I yearn to [walk on the internet](https://syllabusproject.org/syllabus-for-taking-an-internet-walk/), to bump into people on the [dithering website](https://ditherit.com/) when I go to get a new batch of prints, to bring [homemade gifts](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-11-dedications-gifts-odes) to my poeticomp[^4] friends. I wish to _host_ others on my websites, welcome them in at the door and offer them a snack, and make [infrastructure](https://playhtml.fun/) that enables others to do the same. I want to make tools that empower people to embed their personality into the fabric of the bits that surround us. I hope to make environments that embrace participation, ones that invite us to mold the internet as a [material](https://www.are.na/editorial/on-elemental-computation) for creation and a medium for connection.

I want people to own their data and digital land, to play with new worlds for and ways of relating to each other, to explore different paces for moving on the web, to broadcast what they love without relying on the [breath of the gods](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/lit-up-like-a-sparkler/#gods), to collectively maintain the network of services they rely upon.

I want us to feel the latent poetry in our everyday digital interactions, to realize that we enchant technology with meaning with each action we take, to understand that we are all actively shaping, [programming even](https://gist.github.com/melaniehoff/95ca90df7ca47761dc3d3d58fead22d4), all technology as we use it.

In its simplest expression, I want us to be able to feel the warmth of the human behind every hypermedia, every piece of data that we encounter.[^5]

### **Am I flying now?**

_a screenshot of a message from Jacky, originally shared in my_ [_original announcement_](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/towards-flight) _of independent work a year ago_

Am I flying now?

It sometimes feels so, like I'm so high up, nothing can bring me down. Other times, I feel like a self-aware Icarus, the heat on my back threatening a catastrophic fall.

When I write about my projects and future visions for them, I fill up pages that encompass more than a year of work. I cannot fathom how fast time passes me as I work on what I have started to call my life's work. I am haunted by the urgency to earn enough money to sustain myself, to get the status that I think I need to easily get the former, to reach the hearts of more and more people with my work.

I worry I'm doing too much as much as I worry about going fast enough. I hunger for more impact even as I yearn to cherish life for all its simple joys. I, like most of us, am a paradox, always wanting the best of both worlds.

I don't have the answers moving forward, aside from a feverish belief in figuring out a way to balance my conflicting desires. To do the work that I believe in, spark new ways of thinking about computers, touch hearts, and have the ability to craft a good, modest life from it.

---

I've been thinking about role models to aspire towards, spirits that can inspire me with direction when I'm feeling lost. I want to be as prolific and wide-ranging as Virgil Abloh and Isamu Noguchi. I want to be as diligent as Ruth Asawa and Bret Victor. I want to be as principled as Robert Irwin. I want to be as dauntless as Omar Sy and Sean Lew. I want to be as imaginative as Issey Miyake and Sarah Sze. I want to be as nourishing as [Manuel Blum](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/24/1081478/manuel-blum-theoretical-computer-science-turing-award-academic-advisor/).

I keep reading and re-reading accounts of people who have followed paths that seemed like "career suicide." Like [Omar Sy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-formidable-charm-of-omar-sy), who I first discovered in 2021, starting fresh as a relatively unknown upstart in the U.S. acting world after winning the top acting prize in France.

With every new endeavor I undertake, I find myself a little more traditionally illegible. My accomplishments don't easily fit into the boxes of the identities that I straddle.

I am queering my career on this path, carving a space of possibilities that only I can fill.

---

My dream is to build a vehicle that will sustain me and my explorations for life. To offer alternate forms of interacting with and existing in relation to computers and each other online. To create infrastructure, environments, and instruments that enable others to do the same. To craft an [internet that believes in us](https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/our-internet/).

I dream of being able to work with many people working on different areas in this space—from the base level protocols and infrastructure to speculative interfaces and provocative multimedia art—to dedicate myself to the questions that won't get raised otherwise, to question ingrained expectations about the ways we're allowed to relate to one another in digital spaces, to fight for all the humanity that the internet represents.

I still don't know if I can sustain what I do. Last year, I survived off of a couple grants, one freelancing gig, and several small honorariums.

This year I'm devoting myself to making the pathways for sustainability more concrete and stable. Perhaps my patronage / sponsorship can be more attractive. Perhaps I can start a small indie game x product x art studio that charges modestly for small-scale works made with love (currently available for [custom commissions](https://spencer.place/collab/) of website-infused ceramics!). Perhaps I can do more values- and goal-aligned client collaborations[^6].

---

For a long time, I treated this independent period as a temporary one, as if it was predetermined I would fall at some point.

Even as I've explored all these avenues of creation, I've dismissed my time as a "sabbatical" or downplayed the importance of my work. I've contained my energy when I explain what I do and omitted important aspects out of fear of overwhelming others.

I'm afraid of committing because it means confronting the possibility of failure.

I want to try to commit. To dedicate myself to this life, one filled with time for the things and people I love, to build it piece by piece so that it lasts a [lifetime](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/spines-for-a-lifetime).

If I must descend from the sky, let it be in a brilliant ball of fire rather than a resigned descent. Let me invite catastrophe. And when I fall, let me be born anew from the ashes and find a new wind to carry me forward.

> "So I quit, carrying nothing more than my hope. A hope that I would be able to loosen my grip a bit, clear my scars, and start to ask myself what I could do with this short, infinitely valuable life of mine." --Meghna Rao in [bylinebybyline](https://www.bylinebyline.com/articles/work-anti-work)
