_Fan Ho -- Inferno, 1962_

I'm sitting at a dining table in Atlanta, across a fake Christmas tree. There are 4 days left until the year ends, and I'm dreading the start of 2025. I feel uncertain. I'm restless, turning to my devices and other chronic obsessions to divert my attention. Last week I looked up "OCD self-remedies reddit." Every time I start chewing my lip, I try to force myself to clench my fist for a minute as one Redditor suggested. I want more time.

The word I set for [**2024 was spiraling**](https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/spiraling/). I evoked the eye of cyclones and forming continuous rituals and taking the windy path. I wished to be like water, to be a gentle mover like Ruth Asawa. I dreamed of creating a vehicle to sustain myself and my explorations [**for life**](https://spencer.place/posts/one-year-research/).

Instead, I struggled against the current and floundered in the water. I was more often caught in the middle of the storm than controlling it from the eye. The chaos consumed me, moving me frenetically from one thing to the next. I switched focuses depending on the day, without a central direction guiding me.

I felt fragile. I second-guessed choices and double-checked my priorities. I couldn't commit myself to things without looking the other way, glancing back at perceived opportunity costs.

I optimized in so many wrong ways. I worked to achieve sustenance rather than to flourish. I lived for survival rather than for my wildest dreams. I told myself I would bet on myself this year, but in many ways, I still hedged my bets and stalled myself from making big decisions. Even though I did so many more new things, likely more than I ever have, I still _feel_ like I played it safe.

I feel lost. I'm confused why I'm so disappointed.

At the same time, this year was full in every sense of the word. I did so many things that I've only dreamt of, so many firsts.

I started an online store for [internet sculptures](https://objects.spencer.place/) and hosted a packing party, designed a physical installation for [AcknowledgeNET](https://spencer.place/creation/acknowledgenet/) to exhibit at Gray Area, had my off-the-cuff post about my [interactive pillow](https://x.com/spencerc99/status/1818721711858368890) go viral, visited taiwan with my parents & walked around my mom's college campus, went to a wedding with R, moved in with S, got a car, designed a computing shrine with L and prototyped one with V, took a sculpture class at CCSF, gave away many fortune cookies and sold many, too, went to see the eclipse (unsuccessfully), taught my first [public](https://spencer.place/creation/neighborhood-internets-workshop) [workshops](https://spencer.place/creation/touching-computers-creating-data-talismans/) including an international one, made and released [Gather](https://gather.directory/) my first ever mobile app, got a haircut I love, went to the last XOXO and watched friends speak, made a lot of art and bought a lot of art, started NEW INC Y11 in New York, formed new creative pods, and secured my first few custom client commissions.

My friends keep saying you're making it happen, you're doing what you said you would. So why do I feel so dissatisfied??

I'm back in San Francisco now. It's a beautiful chilly day by the beach. The sun is shining brightly and the sky is blue as far as the eye can see. I watch the waves lurch and dance and devastate. I imagine myself caught in the middle of one, tumbling into the depths. I want to welcome the certainty.

I keep thinking of Omar Apollo's song [Pedro](https://open.spotify.com/track/55VlWrmu8vPgOf2MnGS1tO?si=fa3adde9f03d4656). It's an unsuspecting one in Apollo's newest album. Sitting near the end and feeling more like an interlude than record single, it features an unedited voice note from the actor Pedro Pascal. He shares about a time he felt "absolutely shattered" while in Lucerne mid-COVID. One day while walking, he says "I remember thinking [of] the saying "It brought me to my knees." And it was this sort of residential area. And I remember just literally being kind of brought to my knees... By a park bench, and, um And I remember asking the park bench to come alive and save me 'cause I didn't feel like there was kind of any moment past that moment. But there was.. there was."

This song was a source of solace for me throughout the year. I suppose hearing Pedro talk about his desperate plea for help made me feel less lonely in my lowest moments. I'm not even sure what I'm asking for saving from. Myself and [my dreams](https://spencer.place/newsletter?i=the-weight-of-dreams)? The world, which can be as cruel as it is invigorating? The harsh conflicts that arise out of deep love? The loneliness that comes from building a community? The inadequacy that comes from being a creative?

As part of my ritual of picking a word to define the new year, I've been searching for a word to save me.

It was hard to find a word that felt right this year. I kept returning to last year's words. I kept searching for ones that were more romantic, more elaborate, more poetic. I thought about being _grounded_ and _centered_. I wanted control after all the chaos of last year. I looked at the other extreme---leaning into the current and the winds, becoming _weightless_ and _anchorless_. I want to be _inevitable_. But _gentle_, like the way the rain falls. like water going over a rock.

But none of the words feel right. _A_ urged me to evaluate why I keep reaching for more meaning. Maybe all my poetic reaching just makes me feel good without challenging me to change. Perhaps I'm looking for my savior in the wrong place.

_"Horizon" Poster for Muji by Kenya Hara, 2003_

A fear I have held onto for too long is my fear of being perceived poorly. Which is a fancy way of saying I'm afraid of my ego. My ego keeps blocking me from making my art. It keeps asking, for what? and who will care? and what numbers will it do when you share it? These are all real questions with real and meaningful impacts that determine whether I will successfully pay my bills as a full-time indie creative, but they shouldn't be the things that direct where my creative energy should go. They should be strategic---focused on the how rather than the what.

On my long list of word candidates, one makes me cringe.

- _"everyday, normal"_

_Normal_ feels so... unremarkable. I think of all the teen shows I watched growing up where every protagonist goes through their outside phase and "just wanting to be normal." It's trite and uninspiring. It's what people want when they have no imagination for how they could go outside of the mold. It repels me by its very nature because I want to be _different_ by my very nature. I want to be _special_.

But I'm just giving myself a reason to abandon self-care, work myself to the bone, and let down my community. I am losing myself in my absolute desire to do something new and important. I am losing myself in my ambitions, trying so desperately to escape this normal reality.

I'm done with asking to be saved.

In 2025, I want to be normal. I want to manifest the stability, the ego-less, casual ease of the everyday. I want my _different_ to be my normal. I want all the the crazy ideas, the wacky gatherings, the "is this really okay?" schemes to be ordinary. I want to stop fighting against myself---to stop second-guessing and back-tracking and pre-launch waffling.

Instead of looking inward, I want to look outward. I want to focus on what I can do for other people, my neighborhood, and the world rather than myself. I want to let the things that come, come to me. Everything must be connected to something else. I can no longer isolate myself for safety. I want to engage, to entangle, to attach, and figure out how to detach messily. I want to sort through the mess, wade through the flood, find destiny in a catastrophe. I want to catalyze chain reactions, start self-sustaining cycles, and activate perpetual energy.

Back in 2020, I wrote about [quiet confidence](https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/), "when you're able to naturally take your time, take up proper space, and be unapologetically yourself without putting down anyone else or manufacturing dependence." I read about [rayne-fisher quane's cruel optimism](https://internetprincess.substack.com/p/cruel-optimism-new-year) and decide that I am an optimist after all, no matter how [cruel my dreams](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-weight-of-dreams) may be.

My perpetual energy will come from the routines I ground myself in. I'm training for the SF half. I've been going to Sunset Gym. I have a Sunday calendar event titled "make PLANS and call someone you dummy" to goad myself into hosting events to bridge the diverse communities I find myself in. I'm pushing my shoulders back, unclenching my jaw, smiling at strangers, putting down the computer, and staring at the sky with no agenda and trying what feels right.

I'm embracing the ideas I obsess over daily, committing to seeing them through even if it's only a few minutes every few days. I'm embracing time with friends, old and new, and gatherings that make me think _I can't believe I get to do this right now_, everything from the creative party in an abandoned building to a perfect day in the park to Wikipedia rabbit holes and finding a new creative outlet. I'm embracing the philosophy that it doesn't matter how ambitious my goals are if I'm not having fun, giving to others, and feeling grateful for every day of my life.

I know I'm returning to old habits again, but I do want to be _inevitable_. And reaching for "normal" actually feels like a path for getting there: normalcy as survival mechanism, as playing for the long game, as building a [spine for a lifetime](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/spines-for-a-lifetime).

Joan Didion writes, "every day is all there is." That's all we have and it's the only thing that matters.

Every day, I want to ask myself: "Did you have fun? Would you choose to do it all over again?"

This year is the year I manifest my normal life as a working artist and creative, as a given rather than something to be proved. I'm committing to myself as a partner, a friend, a collaborator, a neighbor, and friendly stranger. Just another person who loves to laugh and cry and see the sparkle in others' eyes.

I saw this Audrey Lorde quote from annie's [reflection of the year](https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=1612450&post_id=153911638&utm_source=post-email-title&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=2037y&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozMzYzNDA2LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNTM5MTE2MzgsImlhdCI6MTczNTc3MjQ1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4MzY0NDU1LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTYxMjQ1MCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.G9zPpGI7NeLaowW2ZehTHTdMZ06g0-f0G2Yq4Nj_quc), and I'm thinking about how Audrey Lorde fought, ruthlessly, to make her life (and all the people she represented) normal. The fight was about normalcy, acceptance, the privilege of the everyday.

And Albert Casmus' _Return to Tipasa_ and the courage to hold an endless wellspring of joy---one that fuels a perpetual fight for justice---to submit to the depth of winter and loss and frustration and despair and still, still declare defiantly that an infinite, invincible summer exists within you.

I'm thinking about the kinds of things that are important for me to focus on this year, a sort of manifestations list.

1.  make someone's day

2.  host an event(s) that people still think back on at the end of the year

3.  blurry photos that go in the favorites album

4.  everyday tools

5.  lifelong gifts

6.  change someone's mind

7.  inspire someone's project

8.  and when I'm feeling unmotivated, unfocused, unlike myself

    - stretch hamstrings, strengthen knees

    - lay down close eyes and do nothing, let mind race (or nap) for 15 mins

    - stare out window and doodle

    - do pushups / pullups / ab rollouts

## updates

- **Gather** is officially out in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gather-handheld-curiosity/id6468843059) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.tiny_inter.gather&hl=en_US)! I finally caved to Apple and changed my donation model to use in-app purchases for them 🤦 Share with a friend! And if you enjoy it, please do leave a review.

- New year new restock of the [Fortune Webstones](https://objects.spencer.place/). I'm gonna get to experimenting with some molds for the pillows soon and finalizing the app to set them up. I'm also actively looking for museum/design stores to stock, so let me know if you have any suggestions or contacts you can hook me up with :)

- [nothing on my computer](https://www.instagram.com/p/DExrfVMSczI/?img_index=1), a 24-hour live stream of my computer, debuted in December for DO NO-THING. It was really fun and interesting to work with my desktop as a medium for art without any website or coding work at all. It almost felt like I was cheating because it was so fun to poke at the interfaces given and try to make something interesting out of them. This is the kind of pure creative joy that I love when I find for the first time!

- There's many more exciting things in the works that I hope to share soon! Despite all the ups and downs and existential uncertainties, I feel so grateful for being able to do this work---my choosing of what is interesting, wacky, fun and important---with so much freedom. You, the person reading, sharing, and engaging with my thinking, are a huge part of how it's all been possible, so thank you from the bottom of my heart.

- **Invite me to be your Creative-in-Residence**: At the same time, I've actually been thinking that I have _too_ much agency these days. When I have to context-switch between several things that all require high-level creative direction and strategic decision making, I can feel my brain tearing itself apart. So I've started to explore what it would look like to emulate a more seasonal working style, taking after [Robin's olive oil season](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/moonbound/) and other historical seasonal work. To start, I'd like to spend one season (say 2-3 months of the year) working for / embedding in a studio or company doing work that simultaneously resonates with a lot of the motivations or ends of my work but in a way that is also very different from the _way_ I work or what ends up being produced. Prime examples that I'd be interested in exploring this with are MSCHF, Bluesky, Olafur Eliasson's studio, and the Internet Archive. How I'd integrate is flexible depending on the host, but I imagine it'd be somewhere between a very capable intern and a creative-in-residence: directly helping push forward existing projects while proposing and producing small collaborative artifacts. If you have leads for the examples I mentioned or other suggestions for potential hosts or ways to approach this successfully, let me know
