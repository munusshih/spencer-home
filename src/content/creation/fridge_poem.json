  "descriptionMd": "A poem about picking up trash is materialized as fridge magnets. Each word is movable by visitors, so the piece is changed by anyone who visits, creating a site of communal poetry creation. By giving visitors the power of free-form movement, words take on a life of their own and the shape of the original poem is transformed into the particular desires and intuitions of visitors on any given day. How do words transform when they are adopted by a new owner? Who dictates meaning in a communal space?",
