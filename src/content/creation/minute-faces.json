  "descriptionMd": "As time has increasingly become a fungible unit for productivity and capitalist utility, clocks have been converted from ambient landscapes into tools for controlling us.\n\"minute faces\" reimagines the modern clock as an ambient environment, rooted in its origins, that invites us to not only pay attention to the natural movements of time but also become acquainted with each minute of the day as its own person. The environment is designed to adapt to any viewing size, from a large-format projection to your desktop background to a small window or watch face.\nIn “minute faces,” the current time hovers in the center with their shadows orbiting, inspired by the trajectory of a mechanical clock's hands. The background of the website changes over time in rhythm with how time passes in the physical world: the brightness mirrors the sun’s movement and each minute progresses proportionally through the color wheel, yielding a unique color for every minute of the day.\nGiving space to continuous measures of time, the current season and an ever-increasing representation of the life of computing—the current UNIX timestamp—are displayed on the edges. As time passes, this website will also age, until one day its entire surface is filled with a record of the history of its host's origin.\n“minute faces” subverts our frictionless digital experiences by asking for continued presence before yielding anything “useful.” As a visitor spends more time on the site, they gain the ability to recognize the minute of day by its color palette.\nWhat does time become when each minute is humanized? How does a tool change us when it becomes an environment?\ncreated for [taper 12](https://taper.badquar.to/12)",
