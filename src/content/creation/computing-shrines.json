  "descriptionMd": "We face an increasing loneliness epidemic as free third spaces for communities continue to disappear. Computing Shrines responds to this crisis by reimagining technology as a public good for fostering local connection rather than replacing it.\nComputing Shrines is a protocol for and a collection of public installations that transform shared spaces into places for meaningful exchange. Each shrine consists of a passively powered structure that connects visitors' phones to a site-specific web experience, each built around an interaction of exchange between past and future visitors. These websites can only be accessed at their shrine, anchoring a virtual space to a physical place.\nAs cyber-physical objects, these shrines become living archives of our collective everyday interactions, from natural physical patina to the meaningful data visitors contribute. These stories and memories imbue these spaces with a material sense of the people of that place that transcend their physical containers.\nFor example, \"Shrine to Voice\" is an acrylic phone booth for mobile phones that invites visitors to listen to the last visitor’s voice message and share their own worries and hopes with the next stranger. Other examples include “Shrine to Wishing” and “Shrine to Libraries,” that invite visitors to share wishes and log check-ins at neighborhood libraries.\nMore than an installation, Computing Shrines is an open protocol for anyone to create their own public good technology. Designed with common materials and electronics, open-sourcing the web experiences, and collaboratively collecting instructions by local stewards, the project embraces accessible technology and transforms the normally solitary act of creating technology into a community project\nComputing Shrines reclaims technology, from a system that steals attention, as a critical tool for empowering people within local communities to talk to and see one another, while nurturing the agency to shape technology for themselves.\nSupported by [APOSSIBLE](https://apossible.com/), [DAL](https://dalab.xyz/en/), and [NEW INC](https://newinc.org/).",
