  "descriptionMd": "Our mobile phones have simultaneously become some of our most intimate companions and our greatest enemies of our attention. They receive more attention and intimate touches than most of our loved ones, yet they are also demonized for their positions in our lives. \n*everyday* seeks to highlight these everyday interactions with our devices and turn them into material for meaningful reflection, exploration, and play. Hourly prompts act as digital poems—brief, evocative invitations to play with our devices in new, physical ways. Participants’ movements are transformed into a unique artwork visualizing fleeting gestures as colorful marks against a blank canvas. Playful, intimate, and sometimes absurd, the prompts in everyday—cradling, tracing, spinning, or even protecting a device—slow the rhythm of digital engagement, offering a moment of pause within an otherwise continuous flow of information.\nThe project lives as a website designed to be saved to a device homescreen to be revisited as a ritual for reclaiming our agency from our devices and finding new ways to surprise ourselves in these daily, intimate interactions with technology. \nCommissioned by [Hyundai Artlab](https://artlab.hyundai.com/) for their [Digital Commissions](https://artlab.hyundai.com/project/artlab-digital-commissions) in 2025.",
