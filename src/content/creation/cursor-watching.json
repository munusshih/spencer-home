  "descriptionMd": "*cursor watching is a multimedia installation and collective performance exploring how we watch and are watched on the internet*\n*cursor watching* plays with the contrasting extremes of institutional surveillance and human witnessing inherent to browsing the internet to question how we watch and are watched in the process. Mimicking a surveillance feed at first glance, the website reveals itself upon closer attention to be a collection of live windows looking onto various corners of the internet. Re-presenting our everyday internet activity as a collective performance, this internet environment invites visitors to consider how they show up in internet spaces and how their digital acts are perceived.\n*cursor watching* situates visitors in a position, commonly associated with conducting surveillance (sitting in front of a computer screen, watching multiple windows of activity) while subverting expectations of what surveillance content should look like.\nThe video feeds are composed of iframes of websites from across the internet that show the life of visitors (both present and past) or lives lived on the internet. The frames are zoomed in to create surreal compositions that render even familiar sites strange by focusing in on displaced corners and unusual details. Across the different feeds, the life of the internet unfolds: from the traces of visitors past to real-time presence and activity to the neverending movement of GIFs. Unlike a static surveillance feed, visitors can choose to interact with the featured sites, recording themselves into the history of the website, or embrace lurking and simply watch.\nSwitching between these modes yields conflicting emotions: the whimsy that comes from watching the movements of people and the voyeurism that comes from watching while unseen. The site serves as an altar to the diverse life happening in every moment on the internet in its varying corners and interrogates what it means to see each other online in the way that we all want to be seen.\n*cursor watching* has been exhibited in New York.",
