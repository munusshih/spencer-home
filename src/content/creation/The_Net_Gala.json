The main feature is a pop-up art exhibit, featuring several artists who specialize in digital and internet-enabled art pieces. We expect about 400 attendees, including executives from the East Coast’s top cybersecurity firms, security operators and vulnerability researchers, and members of the media such as 404 Media, Gizmodo, TechCrunch, and the New York Times.”",
