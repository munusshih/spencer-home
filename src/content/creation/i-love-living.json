  "descriptionMd": "*i love living* is an ongoing archival piece of all the moments you feel gratitude for life created by folk software, the kind made in-place in the context of existing devices and technologies. The piece is activated for each individual when it is installed onto phone as an automation. Once installed, the automation enables the user to tell their device voice assistant “I love living,” which archives a timestamp, location, and a front and back photo from the device’s camera to an on-device note called “i love living.” This piece leverages the power of archival that all of our devices offer us and activates a lasting archive and performance piece for each person that installs it.\n[Install it on your device (iOS only)](https://spencers.cafe/projects/i-love-living).",
