  "descriptionMd": "*(we)bsite* is a living collection of internet dreams from people like you, inhabitants of the internet. It aims to create space to hold, show, and uplift everyday visions and hopes for the internet. A living exhibit that continuously evolves with the actions of visitors (each letter contains fingerprints from past visitors who have touched them)\nDespite all the time we spend on the internet, most of us are passive consumers of content and interfaces. Our standard digital environments do not offer let alone encourage us to imagine and create alternative futures for the internet.\nWhat if everyone who used the internet was encouraged to dream about it? What would it look like if we collectively imagine and build a better internet together?\nChange starts with possibility. We hope *(we)bsite* can be a catalyst for change by showing all the love, care, memories, and dreams that people have for the internet.",
